## Chapter 1: Stay calm, don't panic

**Wary:** Listen, I recently got a strange message. Apparently my electricity would be cut off if I didn't pay right away. I was really scared.

**Curious:** Did you pay?

**Wary:** Fortunately not! But my heart was pounding. Only later did I think - maybe it's a scam?

**Curious:** Good thing you held back. You know, my neighbor clicked on such a link and lost money. She said she was ashamed to talk about it.

**Wary:** That's strange - why should we be ashamed? It's the criminals who are scamming us, not us doing something wrong.

**Curious:** Exactly, but scams work in two ways. Either they send us fake messages - pretending to be a bank, police, energy company, doctor, or someone from the family. Or we ourselves go to dangerous websites.

**Wary:** How do we go to dangerous websites? I certainly don't look for anything bad on purpose!

**Curious:** But sometimes we want to watch a movie for free, or download something... And we end up on a website that looks normal, but steals our data. And you know what's worst? Criminals know that if a website offers something embarrassing - like illegal movies or adult content - we won't go for help because we'll be ashamed.

**Wary:** That's true... But why do these scams work at all?

**Curious:** Because they exploit our emotions! I saw a talk about this.[1] Criminals want us to feel **fear** - they write "we'll close your account!", "police issued a warrant!", "your electricity will be cut off!". Or **greed** - they write that you won a prize or they have an attractive risk-free investment for you. They even exploit **love** - we meet someone online, we have nice conversations, and after a few months that person suddenly needs money. And sometimes they play on **shame** - that's what we were talking about, they count on us being ashamed to ask for help because the scam happened on an embarrassing website.

**Wary:** Indeed, when I got that message about electricity, I immediately felt fear and wanted to deal with it quickly. I wasn't thinking calmly.

**Curious:** That's exactly what they want! They want us to act under the influence of emotions, before we think or ask someone for advice.

**Wary:** And you know what else? My granddaughter said she got a message that her grandmother - that's me! - is in the hospital and needs payment. Can you imagine? Someone was pretending that I needed help!

**Curious:** That's a classic scam! And listen, this is important - virtually everyone online gets such messages. It doesn't mean you did something wrong. Criminals send millions of messages, hoping someone will respond.

**Wary:** I thought it was just me...

**Curious:** No, no! They scam young and old. Technical people also get fooled, because criminals are professionals. If someone scammed you - it's not your fault.

**Wary:** Good to hear that. But what should I do when such a message comes and I feel that fear?

**Curious:** Recognize that feeling! That's your warning. Don't act right away. You need time to verify it.

**Wary:** Verify? But how?

**Curious:** Maybe let's talk about that another time, I'm in a hurry now, and nothing happened anyway, right?

**Wary:** Yes, I guess you're right... But what if something did happen?

**Curious:** First of all - don't panic and don't be ashamed! Being a victim of a scam happens to many people. First: immediately call the official contact number of the organization it concerns - not the number from the suspicious message! For example, if it's about a bank, the number might be on the back of your payment card. If it's about an energy company - find the number on their website or bill. If it's about an ad for a miracle drug - ignore such messages completely, real prescription drugs are prescribed by a doctor. Second: definitely tell someone trusted and tech-savvy - they will help you assess what to do next, like changing passwords.

**Wary:** Good to know. Next time I'll be calmer.

**Curious:** Yes, staying calm is our best defense!

**Type:** true-false
